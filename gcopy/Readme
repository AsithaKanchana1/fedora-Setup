# G-Copy Setup "App"

This is an interactive setup script to automatically configure a scheduled `rclone` backup service on Fedora, using modern systemd user timers.

## How to Use

1. Save the Script:
Save the `setup-gcopy.sh` file to your computer 

2. Make it Executable:
Open your terminal, navigate to where you saved the file, and make it executable:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
chmod +x setup-gcopy.sh
```

3. Run the "App":

Run the script and follow the on-screen prompts.

```bash
./setup-gcopy.sh
```

The script will guide you through checking rclone, configuring it, and setting your backup paths and schedule. It will then create and start the automatic service for you.
